# Event-Driven Architecture Integration Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the staged approach to integrating all DarkVelocity POS services through Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). Each stage is designed to be **independently workable** with clear dependencies noted.

  builder.Services.AddInMemoryEventBus();
  builder.Services.AddEventHandlersFromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly);
  ```

- [x] **1.2** Update OrdersController to inject IEventBus

- [x] **1.3** Publish `OrderCreated` event when order is created
  - Include: OrderId, LocationId, UserId, OrderNumber, OrderType

- [x] **1.4** Publish `OrderLineAdded` event when line items added
  - Include: OrderId, LineId, MenuItemId, ItemName, Quantity, UnitPrice, LineTotal

- [x] **1.5** Publish `OrderCompleted` event when order is completed
  - Include: OrderId, LocationId, OrderNumber, GrandTotal, full Lines array

---

## Implementation Pattern Reference

Use Auth↔Labor integration as the reference implementation:

**Publishing Events (see UsersController.cs:130-140):**
```csharp
await _eventBus.PublishAsync(new UserCreated(
    UserId: user.Id,
    TenantId: location.TenantId,
    // ... other properties
));
```

**Handling Events (see EmployeeEventHandlers.cs):**
```csharp
public class EmployeeTerminatedHandler : IEventHandler<EmployeeTerminated>
{
    public async Task HandleAsync(EmployeeTerminated @event, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Handle the event
    }
}
```

**Registering in Program.cs:**
```csharp
builder.Services.AddInMemoryEventBus();
builder.Services.AddEventHandlersFromAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly);
```
