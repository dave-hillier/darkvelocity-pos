### 17. System Domain

**Completeness: 35%**

#### Current Implementation
- Alert grain with rule engine structure
- Alert types and severity levels
- Email inbox with attachment processing
- Workflow grain (generic state machine)
- Webhook subscription management
- Good test coverage

#### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Priority | Effort | Description |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------|
| NotificationGrain | Critical | 80-120h | INTERFACE ONLY - no implementation |
| Webhook Delivery | Critical | 60-80h | Returns mock success, no HTTP calls |
| Alert Evaluation | Critical | 40-60h | EvaluateRulesAsync() is a stub |
| Background Jobs | High | 40-60h | No scheduled processing |
| API Endpoints | High | 30-40h | No alert/workflow endpoints |
| Blob Storage | Medium | 35-50h | Email attachments not persisted |
| Circuit Breaker | Medium | 20-30h | Webhooks fail permanently |

#### Recommended Actions

```
Phase 1 (Critical - 4 weeks):
├── Implement NotificationGrain (email, SMS, Slack, push)
├── Implement AlertGrain.EvaluateRulesAsync()
├── Create HttpWebhookDeliveryService
└── Create background job scheduler

Phase 2 (Reliability - 3 weeks):
├── Add webhook retry queue with exponential backoff
├── Implement circuit breaker pattern
├── Create alert/workflow API endpoints
└── Add audit logging

Phase 3 (Operations - 2 weeks):
├── Add blob storage for attachments
├── Create system health monitoring
├── Implement webhook analytics
```

**Total Effort to 90%:** 16-17 weeks (~630-700 hours)

## Architecture Strengths

The codebase demonstrates strong architectural patterns:

1. **Orleans Virtual Actors** - Proper grain key conventions, single-writer principle
2. **Event Sourcing** - JournaledGrain pattern used consistently where appropriate
3. **HAL+JSON APIs** - Consistent REST API design with hypermedia
4. **Composition over Inheritance** - Grains collaborate via grain-to-grain calls
5. **Stream-Based Integration** - Orleans streams for cross-domain events
6. **Multi-Tenancy** - Proper org/site key prefixing throughout
7. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive test patterns (~18,600 lines)
8. **Configuration-Driven Integration** - Fiskaly integration shows good patterns

## Architecture Recommendations

1. **Standardize Event Sourcing** - Convert remaining simple-state grains to JournaledGrain
2. **Add Background Services** - Many features need scheduled processing
3. **Implement Circuit Breakers** - For all external integrations
4. **Add Observability** - OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics
5. **Create Index Grains** - For queryable aggregations
6. **Build Subscriber Pattern** - More Orleans stream subscribers for integration
